# <password-generator>

## Description

This was a project that was created with an emphasis on Javascript. The premise of the project was to create a webpage that will be able to generate a random string of characters that would potentially be utilized as a password. The randomly generated password can be customized by string length, and if the password includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. Additionally this project also demonstrates Javascript coding, on how to create an interactive webpage that displays outputs depending on a user’s input.
