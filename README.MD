The randomly generated password can be customized by string length, and if the password includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters.

This was a project where Javascript learned about lexical scope, generating outputs depending on a user’s input on a webpage, how functions can interact with other functions, javascript definitions.
